# jamieshark dotfiles
 
These are dotfiles I use to personalize my terminal. They are arranged topically (see: https://jogendra.dev/i-do-dotfiles) so as to help separate what things to install for certain environments and machines.

## Installation
Run the following:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/jamieshark/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```
This will symlink the appropriate files in .dotfiles to your home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within ~/.dotfiles and changes are reflected immediately once updated profiles are reloaded.
